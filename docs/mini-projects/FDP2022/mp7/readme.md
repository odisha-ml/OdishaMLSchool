# Medical Speciality Classification from Clinical Notes
### Mentor: [Pravat Ranjan Jena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pravatjena/)
### Problem Statement
The electronic medical records (EMRs) are the source of enormous amount of patients data such as lab test results, medical history, disease status, treatment out comes, side effects, etc.  The processing of unstructured data  captured in EMRs is quite complex problem though it has huge potential for clinical research.  Employing medical staffs for finding insights from EMRs is quite expensive and sometimes prone to human errors. The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning to automate the process of medical speciality classification from clinical prescriptions
### Data
Medical transcriptions dataset available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions) can be used for this project
